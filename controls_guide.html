<h1>Controls — User Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Controls page is used on the day of the rally to record marshal and control times, calculate penalties, and publish results. The Controls page reads the list and order of controls from the Schedule page and displays a corresponding set of control cards for each rally day. Controls do not create or change the schedule,</p>
<p>Page details, blue font represents none editable data, only clerk of the course (COC) penalties and ATA times can be edited.
Results can be either entered manually or results can be automatically populated from Cloud data – refer Control data.</p>
<p>The page has a Normal/Compact button, toggling the button changes the page size.</p>
<h2>Key items</h2>
<ul>
<li>A card is shown for each control defined in the Schedule, STC’s, Marshal’s, Open Control’s, and Start STC’s, each numbered as per schedule sequence.</li>
<li>Controls are processed per day using the day selector.</li>
<li>Expected times (ETA) are calculated automatically.</li>
<li>Actual times (ATA) are entered manually or automatically.</li>
<li>Scores are calculated from the difference between ATA and ETA, max errors 600.</li>
<li>Save and Load use the same workspace as Admin and Schedule.</li>
<li>Print results- presentation options and a summary for multiply rally days.</li>
<li>Export, creates an Excel file of the result which you can then tailor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Page layout</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a clear, card-based layout for entering control times and viewing calculated results.</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>On the left of the page is the listing of entrant details, their speed group, Rally number and lastly their total error score, these field cannot be edited. The entrant Rally number when clicked will open a card enabling the results for that entrant to be entered sequentially rather than panning to individual control cards across the page.</p>
<p>To the right of the entrant details is an optional card for the entry of COC penalties, the “offence” and the points to be awarded, to include these penalties in the final score COC must be checked. Control Cards are displayed left to right in the order they appear in the Schedule. Each card shows one row per Rally number (entrant).</p>
<h2>Day selection</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To select which rally day is being viewed and edited in controls, when you select an alternate day the schedule for that day will be automatically selected, likewise the same applies selecting a day in schedule, the controls for that day will be presented.</p>
<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Day selector at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Select the required day.</li>
<li>The visible cards and data update immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Control cards</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Each card represents one control point and is used to calculate times and scores for each of the entrants based on rally number and speed group.</p>
<h2>Card types:</h2>
<ul>
<li>STC — Self time control cards as defined in the Schedule</li>
<li>Marshal — records arrival times at a fixed control point.</li>
<li>Open Control — similar to Marshal but without certain restrictions.</li>
<li>Start STC — resets the timing baseline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>STC, Marshal and Open Control cards</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To record arrival times (ATA) and calculate penalties, penalties ate limited to +/- 600 seconds, the total score is the absolute sum of penalties.</p>
<p>Expected times (ETA) are calculated and cannot be edited. Blue font.</p>
<ul>
<li>ETA time calculations.</li>
<li>STC - elapsed time from Schedule based on SG of entrant.</li>
<li>Marshals and Open Controls – entrant start time + elapsed time from Schedule based on the SG of entrant.</li>
<li>If a Start STC precedes the control: ETA = Start STC time + elapsed time from Schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If a Start STC time has not been entered, then following card ETA times will remain blank.</p>
<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review the calculated ETA.</li>
<li>Enter the ATA as recorded by the entrants and marshals.</li>
<li>The score updates automatically.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Start STC cards</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A Start STC resets the rally timing. All following ETA times are calculated from this point. STC and Marshal ETA times being calculated based on the Start STC time submitted.</p>
<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the Start STC time provided by each entrant.</li>
<li>Once entered, downstream ETAs update automatically.</li>
<li>Until a Start STC time is entered, expected times for later controls cannot be calculated.</li>
<li>Start STC cards do not record penalties themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> when a Start STC is incorporated into the schedule, later marshal timings are no longer predicable, so this needs to be appreciated and arrangements made accordingly.</p>
<h2>Result Audit</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A tool that will highlight result errors that exceed the audit value selected, to use the tool first select it (check) and then enter a value. Should a control have excessive errors which could be a result of an unexpected route delay, then that control can be removed from the overall results by unchecking it. All control cards are normally checked. In print the results from an unchecked control will be zero.</p>
<h2>Typical workflow</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build the route and controls in Schedule.</li>
<li>Open Controls on rally day.</li>
<li>Select the correct day.</li>
<li>Enter ATA times provided by each entrant</li>
<li>Enter ATA Marshal times.</li>
<li>Review scores or make use of the Audit tool</li>
<li>Deselect any controls to be excluded from the day’s result</li>
<li>Print results</li>
</ul>
<h3>Controls data (Google STC &amp; Marshal ATA imports)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> STC and Marshal times can be submitted electronically, once submitted the results can be downloaded, the control card ATA times populated ready for review and printings of the day results, thus reducing or eliminating manual entries on the rally day.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> When Controls data is set up and connected, the page can fetch the latest control records from the cloud and populate ATA fields for the relevant controls and entrants.</p>
<p><strong>How to use:</strong> Click the Controls data button, a card will be presented, if the cloud service has been setup in Admin then “Connected” will be displayed at the top of the card.</p>
<p>On the controls page to the left of the Controls data button is the Plan OK/Plan changed indicator, if your controls page data is changed, an added control, or an added entrant, after you have already uploaded, then the indicator will wink advising that your uploaded data is out of date.</p>
<h2>Card buttons</h2>
<ul>
<li>View response forms – opens the Google responses page.</li>
<li>Open control data – opens the rally worksheet, select the required tab, review the data awaiting download.</li>
<li>Download controls data – only enabled when there is data available for download, select to import data populating the control cards.</li>
</ul>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Each download will overwrite previous data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload control data – used when all entries and schedule plannings have been finalized.</li>
<li>Entrant and Marshal links, either copy, email or WhatsApp (WA) links to the results forms to be completed.</li>
<li>To WA a link you will need to have WA on your computer, you then send the link to yourself, which you can then share as required.</li>
</ul>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Consider setting up a WA group of entrants, Marshal forms will need to be sent separately, or marshal group.</p>
<p class='note'><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>Entrant results are checked against their Surname and Rally number, if an error is made that submitted will not be added to the worksheet data tab ready for download, it will be included in the error list tab.</p>
<p>Entrant and Marshals can submit more than one return, the last being used.</p>
<p>When a download is performed it will overwrite any previously captured data.</p>
